I got calluses on my hands and feet. They have been bothering me for years. Those on the heel and the bottom of my feet can be painful when walking and sleeping at night. The one under my right foot got so big (2 inches long and 1 inch wide) that I once even considered surgery. I consulted a podiatrist for a while, and then a dermatologist next. I tried treatments at home like soaking, peeling, vinegar, acid, etc. And then patches of all kinds, medication, and then freezing by liquid nitrogen. Nothing worked. When fissures developed, they really hurt.

After we walk our two dogs, we always wash their feet before allowing them back to the floor. A few weeks ago, I started using DOUXO, which we bought years ago for a dog that passed away to take care of his skin problem. I used it to wash the feet of our older dog because he is allegic to normal shampoo. After using it for a week or two, I noticed that my calluses on the hands were disappearing. I spent a day or two, trying to figure out what happened, and concluded that it must have been the shampoo.

I washed my hands and feet with the shampoo for a month. This is what I have been doing:

1. Apply the shampoo with a bit of water to my hands and feet.
2. With a bit of water, massage the calluses.
3. Let the shampoo stay there for a minute or two.
4. Rinse.
5. Occasionally, I still use a callus shaver to trim them down.

After a month, the situation has improved dramatically. See the two pictures, before and after.
