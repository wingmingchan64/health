I got calluses on my hands and feet. They have been bothering me for years. Those on the heel and the bottom of my feet can be painful when walking and sleeping at night. The one under my right foot got so big (2 inches long and 1 inch wide) that I once even considered surgery. I consulted a podiatrist for a while, and then a dermatologist next. I tried treatments at home like soaking, peeling, vinegar, acid, etc. And then patches of all kinds, medication, and then freezing by liquid nitrogen. The last option was very expensive and not covered by my insurance. I only tried once. Nothing worked. When fissures developed, they really hurt.

After we walk our two dogs, we always wash their feet before allowing them back to the floor. A few weeks ago, I started using Douxo dog shampoo, which we bought years ago for a dog that passed away to take care of his skin problem. This time I used it to wash the paws of our older dog because he is allegic to normal shampoo. After using it for a week or two, I noticed that my calluses on the hands were vanishing. I spent a day or two, trying to figure out what happened, and eventually concluded that it must have been the shampoo. So I gave it a try.

I washed my hands and feet with the shampoo daily for a month. This is what I have been doing:

1. Apply the shampoo with a bit of water to my hands and feet, like using liquid soap.
2. With a bit of water, massage the calluses.
3. Let the shampoo stay there for a minute or two.
4. Rinse.
5. Use a callus shaver to trim down the calluses when the skin is dry.

After a few days, the pain stopped. After a month, the situation has improved dramatically. See the two pictures, before and after. I will keep using the shampoo until all calluses disappear.
